## Welcome to Altrad Hofmaninger!

Altrad Hofmaninger is the Austrian branch of Altrad Group. This is the website of the leading producer of wheelbarrows in Europe and my employer. I want to create a basic website, that provides visitors with information about the company and the products.

You can find the live website [here](https://)

The objective is to inform existing and potential future customers about the company, the services and the products they offer. The website should be easy to navigate, informative, basic and simple. Later on, the website could be completed with the product groups, products and prices.

    -   __Naviation bar__
        - The Navigation bar is responsive and has a consistent look and placement on all three sections of the website. It helps the user to easily move from one section to another. It includes the company logo on the left side and Menu and contact links floating on the right side. For better visibiliy, the menu items change their color when the mouse hovers over one of them. It is responsive on multiple screen sizes.

   -   __Landing Page image__

    - The landing area includes a photo and a text overlay that together clearly identify the purpose of the business and the type of product it sells. The button below links to the "about us" section. It also changes the color of the fonts when the mouse hovers over it. It includes a simple Logo, Home page, Menu and Contact links and is responsive on multiple screen sizes. On small screens (e.g. mobile devices) the Home, Menu and Contact links move to under the Logo.



The about us section:

It can be eiter viewed by scrolling down the page to the next section below the main section or by clicking the "About us" link on the navigation bar. This section gives the user a short summary of the companys history, roots and information of the range of produced good. Also it assures the customers and the interested potential customer about the high standards and great quality of the products.

"screenshot of about us"

On the right side a photo is floating showing the team (or a symbol photo of the team) - source?

Contact us section:

"screen shot of contact us"

This section features a link to google maps showing the company location. The link opens externally "www.gooogle..."

Below the map the user can find the full address.

To complete the contact, I placed a contact form for the user to send a message or inquiry. The user is required to enter the full name, e-mail address and to write some text in the message field. The message is being sent by clicking on the "send button" below.

Footer section:

"screenshot of footer"

The footer section contains clickable links to the companys social media accounts like facebook and ...?
Also the copyright information is placed there.



 **404 Error page**
    - In the event of a 404 "page not found" error, the user will be directed to a customized error page which is keeping with the style of the site.

Manual Testing:

Google PageSpeed Insights: optional on desktop, on mobile.. screenshots ans links for all the pages

HtML validator:

The W3 validator (validator.w3.org) highlited errors on the website. which errors found and how corrected

The CC validator found x errors..

if available old screenshot with errors, then corrected, links for all pages

Color Contrast: 

I chose colors that do contrast very well to ensure that also vision impaired users can clearly view the content, buttons, links and other elements.
