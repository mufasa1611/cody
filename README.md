<h1 align="center"<Welcome to Altrad Hofmaninger!>

Altrad Hofmaninger is the Austrian branch of Altrad Group. This is the website of the leading producer of wheelbarrows in Europe and my employer. I want to create a basic website, that provides visitors with information about the company and the products.

You can find the live website [here](https://)

The companys objective is to inform existing and potential future customers about the company, the services and the products they offer. The website should be easy to navigate, informative, basic and simple. Later on, the website should be completed with the product groups, products and prices.

 -  ### Navigation Bar
    The Navigation bar is responsive and present across all thee sections of the website. It helps the users to easily move from one section of the page to another. It includes the companys logo in .png format. The three main sections are directly linked to the menue items floating on the right side. For better visibiliy, the menue items change their color when the mouse hovers over one of them.

Contact us section:

"screen shot of contact us"

This section features a link to google maps showing the company location. The link opens externally "www.gooogle..."

Footer section:
