## Welcome to Altrad Hofmaninger!

Altrad Hofmaninger is the Austrian branch of Altrad Group. This is the website of the leading producer of wheelbarrows in Europe. I want to create a basic website, that provides visitors with information about the company and the products.

You can find the live website [here](https://)

The objective is to inform existing and potential future customers about the company, the services and the products they offer. The website should be easy to navigate, informative, basic and simple. Later on, the website could be completed with the product groups offered, products and prices.

## Features:

The website consists of 3 sections: "Home", "About" and "Contact", a fixed navigation bar in the header and a fixed footer containing the copyright information and social media links.

-  ### Navigation bar:

    - The Navigation bar is responsive and has a consistent look and placement on all three sections of the website. It helps the user to easily move from one section to another. It includes the company logo on the left side and the navigation menu on the right side. For better visibiliy, the menu items change their color when the mouse hovers over one of them and when they get clicked.

- The Contact page provides the user with an interactive google map showing the location of the company along with details on full address, phone number and email address. By clicking the 'View larger map' link the user can go to the google maps site for the address - this opens in a separate tab to allow ease of navigation. The map is fully responsive.

The footer section contains clickable links to the social media accounts like facebook, twitter and instagram. Also the copyright information is placed there.

## Design:

### Color Contrast: 
  + I chose colors that do contrast very well to ensure that also vision impaired users can clearly view the content, buttons, links and other elements.

### Images: 
  + The logo was provided to me from my employer.
  + The landing page main image is a personal photo provided by my work colleague
  + The team symbol photo was taken from www.pexels.com.
 
### Typography
  +   Google fonts were used to import "Sans Serif fonts" into styles.css. 
  + The fonts  'RobotoSerif_UltraC' and 'RobotoSerif_Thin' were downloaded from???? and are placed in the local folder "fonts". 

 ### Wireframes

  +  Balsamiq was used to sketch the first ideas and outlines of the project

+ GitHub was used to host the deployed website

### Languages Used

-   [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

## Testing:

### Validator Testing

#### W3C HTML validator:

 The W3 Html [validator](www.validator.w3.org) found the following errors: 

- Trailing slashes on void elements that had no effect and interacted badly with unquoted attribute values. This could be corrected by simply deleting the slashes.

- google maps did not open correctly because of a mistake in the API key, which was corrected.

#### W3C CSS validator:

- The CC validator found an open div without closing tag, which was corrected.


### Browser Compatibility

I used Lighthouse to test the responsiveness and accesability.
